## 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Joe!

I love solving problems together with other people, often through conversation and code! Reach out on [LinkedIn](ca.linkedin.com/in/joekrump/) if you think there's an opportunity for us to work together on something.

- 🔭 I work as a senior software developer on the frontend infrastructure team at [Clio](clio.com). **[We're hiring!](https://grnh.se/4dq6mp1)**
- 🌱 I’m growing my technical skills by learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
- 💪🏻 I've worked a lot with React, AngularJS, TypeScript, and Ruby on Rails.

### Some other things I'm leveling up in:
- 👨🏻‍🍳 Cooking
- 🎸 Playing ukulele
- ♟ Playing chess
